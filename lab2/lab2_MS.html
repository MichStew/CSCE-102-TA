<h3> The Transition from High School to College </h3> 
<p> The transition was pretty smooth for me. I lived in Bates house freshmen year and had a big emphasis on meeting new people and having a good time, while also prioritizing my school work. My family only lives about an hour away so it wasnt a big deal to go and see them whenever I needed to on a weekend or whatever. My relationship definetly had to grow a lot with how much our lives had changed when coming to college </p> 
<h4> Using Phrase/in-line Elements </h4> 
<p> phrase or inline elements can be used to achieve many different tasks. for example we can add <span style="color:blue">color</span> to a text. We can also point words out <strong>LIKE <strong>THIS, or like <em>THIS</em>. Embedding code may also be useful, and thats possible like this: <code>print("Hello World") </code>. Other ways to add color include <mark> highlighting </mark> or changing the color and typescript like <i style="color: purple;">this</i>.
