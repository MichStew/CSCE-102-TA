<h1> About High School and Family </h1>
<p> I am from Summerville SC, which is where my family currently lives. I have 4 siblings, 3 sisters and 1 brother, who currently also goes to carolina and studies mechanical engineering. I am the second oldest, and am close to being the first to graduate from collede, so im super excited about that! I went to Cane Bay High School, which has around 2000 students in attendance, I played football and didnt care about class to be frank. lol. </p>

<h1> About College and The Future </h1>
<p> I study computer engineering, being a senior I am really trying to get out and meet employed and grow professionally. I really enjoy programming and problem solving in general. When I am not in class or studying, I like to hang with friends (my house is the spot fr), work on my car (just replaced the clutch this past weekend), and most importantly spend time with my girlfriend of 5 years. After school I have plans to stay in South Carolina for at least 5 years, afterwhich I will be looking to move out west. I spent some time in colorado when I was younger so I think that's where I'd like to end up. However, I have lots of family in Texas and wouldn't be mad if I ended up there either. </p>

<h3> How I Celebrated Christmas </h3>
<p> I celebrated Christmas this past year with the family as I usually do. We always sit around and watch christmas movies leading up to the actual day, this is great because I get to spend quality time with my younger siblings and relax a bit since school is out. I usually try to buy gifts by the 10th but sometimes I cut it closer too lol, when the pockets are feeling light. We always watch "Lampoons Christmas Vacation" on the eve of christmas, and my parents make a classic christmas dinner with turkey, stuffing, pies, ham and all sorts of other stuff. We wake up go downstairs and admire all of the gifts under the tree until my parents get up around 9, which feels super late to us kids who have been waiting for what feels like forever. but then we all get to open out gifts and thank our parents!! after the festivities we usually break off and spend some time taking in all the things we got, trying stuff on, etc. and watch movies and eat. Overall a pretty great time </p>

<h3> Goals for the new year </h3> 
<p> This new year has been focused a ton on professional development, one goal I had was getting an internship, which was accomplished. I wanted to get involved in more clubs, which I am currently pursuing with the creation of CSIET and joining the new tech frat on campus that builds websites for non-profits. Overall its been good. Oh, and I also wanted to change the clutch in my car since it has sucked for a long time. This year has actually gone a lot better than I could have imagined from the beginning of it all!! </p>
